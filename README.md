> **HWE-Bench** is a first-of-its-kind, end-to-end automated benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the real-world engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of **Board-level Schematic Design**.
This project goes beyond testing LLM text generation; it implements a fully automated "datasheet-to-physical-verification" pipeline through rigorous static topological rule checking and dynamic SPICE transient simulation.

---

## ✨ Key Features
📄 Data Extraction: Powered by the MinerU engine, it performs high-fidelity parsing of unstructured PDF datasheets, automatically extracting core component parameters and pin networks to build machine-readable JSON component libraries.

🧠 Generation Pipeline: A standardized testing pipeline for evaluating LLM reasoning across core hardware design stages, including module partitioning, component selection, module-level connectivity, and system-level netlist integration.

🔬 Evaluation & Verification: Features a built-in dual-verification engine:

1. Static Rules Engine: Precisely verifies MCU pin allocation conflicts, bus matching, and point-to-point connectivity topology.

2. Dynamic SPICE Engine: Automatically generates .net simulation netlists and invokes LTspice to perform voltage/current limit tests across multi-stage state machines (e.g., power-up, self-locking, and shutdown).

##  🚀Quick Start
### Phase 1: Data Extraction 
Convert unstructured PDFs into an LLM-readable JSON component library.

```bash
cd mineru
python pdf2md.py      # Invoke MinerU engine for high-fidelity Markdown conversion
python pdf_md2txt.py  # Invoke LLM to extract core parameters and pin tables
python pdf_json.py    # Package data into a standard JSON knowledge base using regex
```

### Phase 2: Generation Pipeline
Drive the LLM to complete the system design step-by-step using the extracted knowledge base.

```bash
cd ../pipeline
python "1Module Partitioning.py"  # Generate functional module definitions
python "2Component Assignment.py" # Intelligently assign specific components
python "3Module Schematic.py"     # Generate module-level connectivity netlists
python "4System Schematic.py"     # Integrate and generate the full System Netlist
```

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Verification 
Perform rigorous scoring and physical verification of the generated circuit netlists.

```bash
# Static Rules: Precisely verify MCU pin conflicts, bus matching, and point-to-point topology
python static_rules.py

# Dynamic Simulation: Automatically assemble .net netlists and invoke LTspice for multi-stage state machine stress testing
python spice_*.py
```
